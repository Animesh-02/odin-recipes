    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese, quark or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. </p>
    <p>If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.[1] Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is usually refrigerated). </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Graham Cracker Crumbs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese</li>
            <li>Sour Cream</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Pie Filling (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and some of the sugar in a bowl. Use your fingertips to press the mixture into the bottom of a springform pan. </li>
            <li>Beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the sour cream and vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time on low speed. Pour the filling over the crust. </li>
            <li>Bake the cheesecake in a preheated oven until the filling is almost set. Run a knife around the rim to loosen the sides and allow it to cool before removing it from the pan. Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least four hours before serving. </li>
            <li>Unlike other cakes, you don't want to check for doneness by inserting a knife or toothpick into the center. Instead, don your oven mitts and give the cheesecake a gentle shake â€” if it looks mostly set aside from a slight jiggle in the center, it's done. The center will set as the cake cools. </li>
        </ol>
